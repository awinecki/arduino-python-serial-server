# Arduino project: communicating over Serial USB using Python

This is a project I've started while learning hardware, in this case Arduino.

I've designed it to control 1 Red LED, 2 RGB LEDs, and a simple buzzer over a simple string-based communication protocol directly from Python. This allows using more high level Python structures to implement specific LED/buzzer behaviour, like pulsing colours, or cycling a color on an RGB LED (with a lot cleaner code than using Arduino language).
